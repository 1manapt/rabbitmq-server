        Thank you for using RabbitMQ.

        **STOP NOW AND READ THIS** before proceeding.

        Please read https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md first.

        If you are **certain** that you are eligible for community support from the core team, please
        provide a **detailed** description of how you run RabbitMQ. This will save everyone time.

        We do not guess in this community. Guessing is a very time consuming, and therefore expensive,
        approach to troubleshooting distributed infrastructure, including distributed messaging
        infrastructure.

        Please provide reasonably detailed responses to the following question:

        1. How would you describe the steps you take to deploy RabbitMQ to a (hypothetical) new colleague?
        2. What client libraries, frameworks and their versions are used with RabbitMQ?
        3. How would you describe the steps you take to reproduce the behavior in question to your colleague?
        4. How do you expect RabbitMQ (client library, etc) to behave and why?
        5.
