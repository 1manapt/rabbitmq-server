        ## Before We Start

        Please provide reasonably detailed responses to the question below to help others help you.

        If you omit relevant information, those trying to reproduce what you are about to report will have to guess.
        Guessing is a very time consuming, and therefore expensive,
        approach to troubleshooting distributed infrastructure, including distributed messaging
        infrastructure.
