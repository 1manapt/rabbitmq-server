## RabbitMQ 4.1.0

## Highlights

### AMQP 1.0 Filter Expressions

[PR #12415](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12415) implements `properties` and `appliation-properties` filters of [AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0 Working Draft 09](https://groups.oasis-open.org/higherlogic/ws/public/document?document_id=66227) when consuming from a stream via AMQP 1.0.
String prefix and suffix matching is also supported.

This feature:
* adds the ability to RabbitMQ to have multiple concurrent clients each consuming only a subset of messages while maintaining message order, and
* reduces network traffic between RabbitMQ and clients by only dispatching those messages that the clients are actually interested in.

### Prometheus histogram for message sizes

[PR #12342](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12342) exposes a Prometheus histogram for message sizes received by RabbitMQ.

This feature allows operators to gain insights into the message sizes being published to RabbitMQ, such as average message size, number of messages per pre-defined bucket (which can both be computed accurately), and percentiles (which will be approximated).
Each metric is labelled by protocol (AMQP 1.0, AMQP 0.9.1, MQTT 5.0, MQTT 3.1.1, and MQTT 3.1).

## New Features

### Support for Multiple Routing Keys in AMQP 1.0 via `x-cc` Message Annotation
[PR #12559](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12559) enables AMQP 1.0 publishers to set multiple routing keys by using the `x-cc` message annotation.
This annotation allows publishers to specify a [list](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-list) of routing keys ([strings](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-types-v1.0-os.html#type-string)) for more flexible message distribution, similar to the [CC](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/sender-selected) header in AMQP 0.9.1.

### OAuth 2.0 Token Renewal on AMQP 1.0 Connections
[PR #12599](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12599) introduces support for OAuth 2.0 token renewal on AMQP 1.0 connections.
This feature allows clients to set a new token proactively before the current one [expires](/docs/oauth2#token-expiration), ensuring uninterrupted connectivity.
If a client does not set a new token before the existing one expires, RabbitMQ will automatically close the AMQP 1.0 connection.

### Metrics for AMQP 1.0 Connections
[PR #12638](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12638) exposes the following AMQP 1.0 connection metrics in the RabbitMQ Management UI and the [/metrics/per-object](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/prometheus#per-object-endpoint) Prometheus endpoint:
* Bytes received and sent
* Reductions
* Garbage collections
* Number of channels/sessions

These metrics have already been emitted for AMQP 0.9.1 connections prior to RabbitMQ 4.1.

## Potential incompatibilities

* The default MQTT [Maximum Packet Size](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901086) changed from 256 MiB to 16 MiB. This default can be overridden by [configuring](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#config-file) `mqtt.max_packet_size_authenticated`. Note that this value must not be greater than `max_message_size` (which also defaults to 16 MiB).
